A list of country flags made using pure CSS and single element for each flag. Proudly powered by [Dempoplate](https://github.com/praveenpuglia/demoplate).

## Installation
```
npm install
```

## Run 
```
npm start #for simple css and js
```

### With SCSS
If you plan to use SCSS, try putting your CSS into **src/style.scss**. If you need to use multiple files, import all of them in **src/style.scss**.

```
npm run scss -- -w & npm start
```

Make changes to any file and it'll reflect on every single browser you go to [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)
