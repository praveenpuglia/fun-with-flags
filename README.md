# Fun with Flags

A list of country flags made using pure CSS and single element for each flag. Proudly powered by [Dempoplate](https://github.com/praveenpuglia/demoplate).

## What to look for?
- Single Element
- No text in HTML
- Uses gradients, shadows, transformations and CSS custom properties to create the shapes.
- Uses CSS Counters to generate the counter on top.
- Uses flexbox to align things.
- Uses pseudo elements in some places with filters to do even more.

## Installation
```
npm install
```

## Run 
```

Make changes to any file and it'll reflect on every single browser you go to [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)
